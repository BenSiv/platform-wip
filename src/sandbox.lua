-- Capability-scoped execution for anything that isn't fossci's own
-- trusted code: schema files, extension manifests, and (from M1 on)
-- extension hook bodies. See doc/architecture.md, "Extension sandboxing:
-- pure Luam, no C required" -- this is the whole mechanism, no second
-- language runtime or C-level trust boundary needed.
--
-- Untrusted source is loaded with loadstring and bound to a restricted
-- environment table via setfenv, before ever being called. What that
-- environment contains is entirely up to the caller: schema/manifest
-- loading gets a bare data-construction environment (no os, no io, not
-- even require); extension hooks (M2) get whatever their manifest's
-- declared capabilities grant, built the same way.
