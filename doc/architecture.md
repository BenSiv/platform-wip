# Architecture

## Overview

The system is built around one idea: a record type is data, not code
you write per-type, and every change to a record is remembered, not
overwritten. Defining a new kind of record (a reagent, a sample, a
person) is authoring a small declarative definition; the platform
takes care of storage, validation, a full audit trail, and a queryable
table for that type. Nothing about using the system requires touching
the platform's own source.

```
                     +------------------+
                     |   web server     |   Apache + mod_cgid, PATH_INFO-based
                     +--------+---------+   (src/cgi.lua is the single CGI entry point)
                              |
                     +--------v---------+
                     |     platform     |
                     | record history,  |
                     | registration     |
                     | semantics,       |
                     | accounts/        |
                     | sessions,        |
                     | validation,      |
                     | lineage, queries |
                     +--------+---------+
                              |
                     +--------v---------+
                     |     storage      |   history log (append-only)
                     |                  |   one table per record type
                     +------------------+   accounts
```

The application owns its full request/response cycle end to end: the
web surface, accounts and permissions, and its own rendering. Record
type, extension, and saved-query definitions are plain files, read and
sandboxed at request time -- nothing external to run alongside it to
make any of this work.

## Repository layout

```
bin/        compiled binary (bld/build.sh's output) -- gitignored, never committed
bld/        build.sh/test.sh
doc/        this file, schema.md, extensibility.md
src/        every *.lua source file -- bld/build.sh globs and bundles all of them
            into the single compiled binary, so anything dropped here ships in
            production, including src/agent_provider_test.lua (see "Chat" below)
vnd/        vendored, checked-in third-party frontend assets (e.g. the Toast UI
            Editor bundle) -- served via cgi.lua's own /vendor?name=X route,
            no CDN dependency, no build step
tst/        tst/unit/*.lua (plain Luam scripts, no DB) and
            tst/integration/*.bats (real built binary, real CGI env vars)
```

`src/agent_provider_test.lua` is the one file in `src/` that looks like
it belongs in `tst/` instead -- it's the deterministic stub LLM backend
`AGENT_PROVIDER=test` selects (see "Chat"). It has to live in `src/`
on purpose: `bld/build.sh` bundles every `src/*.lua` file into the one
compiled binary tests run against, and the whole point is that tests
exercise that real binary, not a separate test-only build. The
tradeoff this creates: nothing today stops `AGENT_PROVIDER=test` from
being set in a real deployment by mistake (a stray env var, a
copy-pasted `.env`) -- the app would silently serve canned responses
with no error and no visible difference except the content itself. Not
fixed as of this writing; worth a safeguard if it ever becomes a real
concern.

## History as the source of truth, not a side effect

Two options were considered for "nothing is ever really lost, and
every change is fully accountable": versioning individual records as
files, or an append-only log of changes with a materialized
current-state table per record type. Files were rejected because the
explicit requirement is real downstream analysis -- diffing files
doesn't give you fast joins and aggregations for a dashboard. An
append-only log gives both: nothing is ever overwritten (only
appended), *and* a normal table exists for every record type that a
dashboard can query directly.

```
history log                               <record type> (e.g. "reagent")
  entry_id      (monotonic, the version)    id
  entity_id     (stable logical identity)   <field columns, typed>
  entity_type                               created_by, created_at
  event_type    create | update | archive   updated_by, updated_at
  field_changes (old/new per field)         last_event_id
  author, timestamp                         archived_at (unset = active)
  source references (where the change came from)
```

The log is the answer to "what changed, when, and by whom" for any
record -- append-only, never edited after the fact. A record's own
identity is the id of its own creation entry, so identity is tied
directly to the history itself rather than to whatever the projected
table's own storage happens to assign. Each record type also gets a
real typed table generated from its definition (`schema.md`), kept in
sync in the same transaction as the log entry. That's what a dashboard
queries; nothing about analysis touches the log directly.

**Nothing is ever hard-deleted.** Archiving/unarchiving a record are
themselves just additive log entries -- never a row removal, never a
rewrite of prior history. Listing/counting records excludes archived
ones by default (an opt-in flag brings them back); looking a record up
directly, or its full history, always reaches it regardless of archive
state. Accounts follow the same convention.

### Storage

Runs on SQLite today -- available, reliable, and enough to prove the
history/projection design end to end. The storage layer (`src/db.lua`)
is written as a small, deliberately thin adapter so that moving to a
different backend later, if concurrency or scale ever demands it,
doesn't require touching the history or record logic above it.

Multiple independent installations (each with its own users and data)
are one database file per installation, not one shared database
filtered by an installation id -- clean isolation by construction, and
enough concurrency headroom for many people using one installation's
data at once.

## Sandboxed extensibility

Because record-type definitions and extensions are both just small
scripts, and both need to run without becoming a way for one
definition or extension to reach outside what it was actually granted,
loading either kind of file happens inside a restricted execution
environment: untrusted source runs bound to an environment table
exposing only what's needed for its role -- a record-type definition
gets just enough to construct and return a plain description, nothing
that touches the filesystem, network, or process state; an extension
gets read-only lookups, write access, or networking, but only exactly
what its own declaration asked for and had approved. Nothing gets more
than it explicitly asked for and was granted, and nothing needs a
second sandboxing layer or trust boundary bolted on separately -- one
mechanism covers both.

## Event model

Implemented today:

- **Before-hooks** (`entity.before_create`, `entity.before_update`):
  synchronous, inside the write, and can return issues that block the
  change from happening at all. This is where validation rules live.
- **After-hooks** (`entity.after_create`, `entity.after_update`,
  `entity.after_archive`): queued at write time, executed later
  (see `extensibility.md`), and cannot block or undo anything. This is
  where integrations and derived-record automation live -- a slow or
  broken extension can never hang or corrupt someone's data entry.
  Unarchiving a record does **not** trigger an after-hook today (only
  archiving does) -- not a deliberate design stance, just not wired up
  yet.

Not yet implemented: a batch-level before/after pair distinct from the
per-row hooks (batch validation and creation exist and run the per-row
hooks already, but there's no separate whole-batch hook).

## Pages

A built-in document/notebook record type (not a deployment-authored
one) -- a page's own id is its identity, not its title, so renaming or
moving it is a plain field edit on `title`/`parent_id`, never a
collision risk the way a name-is-identity wiki page has to worry about.

- **A real tree, not a naming convention.** `parent_id` is a nullable
  self-reference (unset = top-level); breadcrumbs are computed by
  walking that chain on read, not cached -- so they can never go stale,
  and moving a page under a different parent is exactly one field
  write. Moving a page underneath its own descendant is rejected
  outright at save time (a real error, not silent data corruption or
  an infinite loop waiting to happen at render time).
- **Cross-page links** use an inline `[[title]]` / `[[folder/title]]`
  syntax, parsed out of the raw content and resolved by title (and, if
  a folder prefix is given, by requiring the resolved page's immediate
  parent to carry that title -- a one-level disambiguator, not a full
  path walk). A link to a page that doesn't exist yet renders as a
  plain, visibly-marked placeholder instead of a broken link. Links are
  a derived index over content (recomputed wholesale on every save, not
  hand-maintained data with their own history) -- the content that
  generates them already has full audit history in its own right.
- **Rendering** shells out to `cmark` (CommonMark) rather than a
  vendored/hand-rolled Markdown parser -- the same "bind to an existing,
  battle-tested implementation" stance as bcrypt/HMAC, except this one
  is an external runtime dependency (must be on `PATH`), not something
  compiled into the binary. `cmark`'s default (non-`--unsafe`) mode
  strips raw HTML out of the source Markdown before rendering, which
  matters here specifically: page content is user-authored and shown
  to other users, so it must never be able to smuggle in a raw
  `<script>` tag.
- Creating/editing a page through the generic `entity create`/`entity
  update` CLI (rather than the dedicated web routes) still works, but
  bypasses link re-indexing -- that's layered on top of the generic
  entity path deliberately (see "Sandboxed extensibility" above: this
  behavior is specific to one record type, not something the generic
  layer should know about), not something every write path gets for
  free.
- **Editing** is Toast UI Editor (vendored into `vnd/`, no CDN
  dependency, no build step), starting in plain Markdown-source mode
  and offering a WYSIWYG mode (syntax hidden, edit the rendered view
  directly) one click away via the editor's own built-in mode tab --
  not two separate features. Either mode still just produces a plain
  Markdown string on submit (`editor.getMarkdown()`), so
  `document-save`'s contract, and everything downstream of it
  (`cmark`, link re-indexing), is unaware the editor ever changed.
  `[[title]]` links are inert literal text in both modes today --
  Toast UI has no notion of the syntax, so nothing renders it specially
  yet (a candidate future addition: a small first-party plugin using
  Toast UI's own widget-rule API, not a fork of the editor).
- HTML generation elsewhere in the app can opt into `src/render.lua`,
  a small `{{ expr }}`-interpolation helper that HTML-escapes by
  default (`{{{ expr }}}` opts out explicitly) -- makes "forgot to
  call `html.html_escape`" structurally impossible for whatever calls
  it, rather than relying on every call site remembering to escape by
  convention. Adopted incrementally (e.g. `html.render_login`'s error
  message); most of `html.lua` still escapes by explicit convention.

## Auth

Every request other than logging in or out requires proof of an active
session, and that proof carries no trust in itself: what an account is
allowed to do is re-read from its current record on every single
request, never cached in or trusted from anything the session carries.
That one property is what makes revoking access, changing someone's
permissions, or archiving an account take effect immediately -- on
their very next request -- rather than only once whatever they're
holding expires on its own schedule.

- **Passwords** are never stored or compared directly -- only a
  one-way, deliberately slow hash (bcrypt) is kept, so a leaked
  database doesn't hand over usable credentials.
- **Sessions** are a signed, tamper-evident token (an identity, an
  expiry, and a cryptographic signature over both) rather than a
  server-side record that has to be looked up and kept in sync --
  verifying one is just checking the signature and the expiry, and a
  tampered or expired token is rejected outright.
- **Cross-site request forgery** is guarded against on every action
  that changes data: a second, independent token has to be presented
  alongside the session and match what was issued with it, so a
  request forged from another site (which can ride along with
  cookies, but can't read or replay this second value) is rejected.
- **Routes**: logging in and out are the only actions available
  without a session; everything else resolves who's asking and what
  they're allowed to do from the verified session before anything else
  runs.
- **Permissions** are short capability strings on the account (a
  baseline capability everyone needs, plus elevated ones for
  higher-privilege actions like ad hoc querying), checked per route.

## Chat

A built-in assistant, not a bolted-on integration: real per-user
conversation sessions, DB-backed history (nothing ever deleted --
compaction marks old turns out-of-context, it doesn't remove them),
and a small, explicit tool registry the model can act through.

- **The LLM backend is pluggable, not hardcoded.** A thin interface
  (`generate(model, system_prompt, prompt)`, optionally `embeddings`)
  is loaded dynamically by name rather than required directly -- the
  real backend (Google Vertex AI, via a `curl` shell-out authenticated
  with fresh short-lived credentials, the same "bind to an existing,
  battle-tested tool" stance used for Markdown rendering and password
  hashing) and a fully deterministic backend used by this project's
  own tests are just two named implementations behind the same seam.
  Routine test runs use the deterministic one -- exercising a real
  paid API on every test iteration would be slow, flaky, and a real,
  avoidable cost.
- **Context-window compaction**: once a session's active history
  crosses an estimated token threshold, everything except the most
  recent few turns gets summarized (via one real model call) into a
  single new message, and the summarized originals are marked
  out-of-context -- never deleted. The chat UI still shows them,
  dimmed, so what the model can no longer see stays visible to the
  human, not hidden.
- **Tool use is a small, explicit registry, not an open plugin
  system** -- the model can only ever call exactly what's listed, with
  no escape hatch to anything else. Today: `document.search/create/
  update` (pages), `entity.list_types/fields/list/get/create/update`
  (any registered record type -- `entity.list_types`/`fields` exist so
  the model discovers real types and field names itself rather than
  the system prompt hardcoding every schema that might ever exist),
  and `knowledge.stats` (read-only summary of the knowledge pool, see
  below).
- **A deployment can append its own instructions to the system
  prompt** without editing platform-wip's own source --
  `theme.json`'s `system_prompt_extra` field (`agent.default_system_
  prompt`) is appended verbatim, empty by default. For domain
  vocabulary, house style, or use-case-specific reminders (e.g. "this
  deployment tracks bioreactor runs -- always ask for the run ID
  before creating a sample") -- the same generic-hook split as every
  other `theme.json` field. Prior art: fossil-scm's own `agent-system-
  prompt-extra` setting.
- **The chat widget tells the model what page the user is on.**
  Every page (`html.page_shell`) emits `window.PLATFORM_PAGE_CONTEXT`
  -- at minimum `{page_type, title}`, richer for entity/document pages
  (`entity_type`, `entity_id`) or views (`view_name`). The floating
  widget prepends a `[Current page: ...]` line built from whatever
  fields are present to every message sent to the model, and the
  system prompt explains what that annotation means so the model
  treats it as reliable context rather than guessing. Stripped back
  out before a human reads the transcript (`agent.display_content`) --
  it's for the model, not something restated back to the user.
- **A destructive tool call cannot execute without a human approving
  it first**, and that approval is a real, persisted two-phase state,
  not a blocking prompt: a single web request can't pause mid-call
  waiting on a person's real-world response time, so a destructive
  request instead gets recorded as a pending action and the request
  returns immediately; a separate, later request (clicking Approve or
  Deny in the chat UI) executes it -- or records the refusal -- and
  only then resumes the conversation. Read-only calls (search) run
  immediately with no approval step; nothing about the mechanism
  distinguishes "asking" from "changing data" except that one fact.
- **Every tool call is attributed to the real, authenticated user
  driving that conversation, never a separate "agent" identity** --
  a page the assistant creates or updates shows up in that page's own
  audit history exactly like a direct manual edit, just additionally
  tagged with which chat session it came from, so the ledger can still
  answer "was this a direct edit or something the assistant did" without
  that ever affecting who it's attributed to.
- **Semantic search** blends keyword matching with embedding
  cosine-similarity when a page has been explicitly indexed -- indexing
  a page is a deliberate, separate action, never an automatic side
  effect of saving it, since computing an embedding is a real API call
  per page. A query's own embedding, by contrast, is computed fresh on
  every search (one cheap, real-time call) -- only the *document* side
  of the comparison is precomputed and cached. SQLite FTS5 was
  evaluated for the keyword half first, per the original plan for this
  feature; confirmed directly that this project's SQLite binding
  doesn't have it compiled in, so search instead scores every active
  page directly, an acceptable tradeoff at the scale this is built for.

## Knowledge pool

`src/knowledge.lua` (retrieval logging, review, full prompt/reasoning
persistence) and `src/document.lua` (tier/heat scoring, the pure
heuristics) together implement retrieval-driven tiering, adapted (not
copied verbatim) from a much larger `ai_note`/`ai_retrieval`/`ai_review`/
`ai_context`/`ai_chat_eval` system in a Fossil SCM fork (see that
fork's own `doc/ai/knowledge-pool-post.md`, "Bubbling Context" -- hot
information rises through use, cold information sinks, never
disappears). Deliberately dropped from that source system:
per-source-type authority weighting and a metadata-quality gate (tied
to fields this codebase's notes don't have).

**Task #106: one unified pool, not two concepts.** Originally
`knowledge_note` was a separate table that mirrored a retrieved
document's title/content into its own shadow row -- a note was never
independently browsable until `knowledge.materialize_note` promoted it
into a real page. Per explicit user direction ("why do we have a
separate note concept? it should all be on the same level but with
different scoring based on tier, heat and relevant"), `tier`/`heat`/
`retrieval_count`/`last_retrieved_at`/`source_type`/`source_id`/
`source_ref`/`content_hash`/`duplicate_of`/`merged_into` are now
columns directly on `document` itself (added via migration --
`document.ensure_document_knowledge_columns`, the same `ALTER TABLE`
pattern as `ledger.lua`'s `ensure_entity_event_reason_column` -- not
`DOCUMENT_SCHEMA.fields`, which would wrongly expose them as
user-editable form fields). A document that gets searched **is** the
record that accrues heat/tier; there's no second row shadowing it.
System/agent-derived content that has no existing page to attach to
(today: a chat's leaked reasoning text; task #107: future distilled
notes) becomes a genuinely new `document` row instead, filed under a
single lazily-created, always-visible top-level Notebook folder
(`document.ensure_knowledge_pool_folder`, titled "Knowledge Pool") --
organized separately from user-authored pages, per explicit user
direction, but never hidden; browsable and searchable like any other
page. The pure tier/heat/dedup heuristics
(`content_hash`/`effective_heat`/`promotion_target_tier`/
`atomicity_status`/`title_is_generic`/`guess_title_from_body`/...) live
in `document.lua` now, alongside the columns they score --
`knowledge.lua` depends on `document.lua`, never the reverse.

- **Every search is logged and scores tier/heat directly**
  (`knowledge.search_and_log` wraps `document.search`; `document.search`
  itself now folds tier/heat reinforcement into its blended
  lexical+embedding ranking, added only *after* the existing relevance
  floor -- a heavily-reinforced document that's actually irrelevant to
  a query is still excluded outright, never ranked highly just because
  it's "hot"). Documents already folded into a canonical duplicate
  (`merged_into` set) are excluded from search outright.
- **Tiers 0-3** (Raw Intake / Working Set / Curated Drafts / Atomic
  Records). A document's `heat` starts at 1.0 and grows by `0.15 +
  tier_weight` (0/0.10/0.20/0.35 for tiers 0-3) on every retrieval hit.
  **Heat decays** (task #87; the source system never had this either --
  heat only ever grew there too): an exponential half-life of 14 days
  computed lazily wherever heat is used for a decision
  (`document.effective_heat`), not a scheduled job rewriting rows --
  this codebase has no in-app background scheduler at all (the one
  periodic job anywhere in the system, Benchling sync, is an external
  systemd timer, not something `cgi.lua` runs). Promotion is automatic
  and threshold-based, never a human-review gate, and genuinely
  bidirectional: recomputed fresh from current `retrieval_count` and
  *decayed* heat every review, not ratcheted upward from the document's
  existing tier -- one that stops being retrieved cools off and drops
  back down, rather than staying at whatever tier it once reached
  forever. `retrieval_count>=2` reaches tier 1; `>=4` with effective
  heat `>=1.60` and non-"needs-split" atomicity reaches tier 2; `>=7`
  with effective heat `>=2.60` and "ok" atomicity reaches tier 3.
  Duplicates never move.
- **Review is rule-based, never an LLM call** for the automatic pass
  that runs after every retrieval: atomicity (heading/paragraph counts
  -- more than one heading or more than six paragraphs is
  "needs-split"; a short single paragraph is "thin"), duplication (a
  content hash matched against a lower-id document), title quality (a
  generic title like "Note" gets regenerated from the document's own
  first real line), and connectivity (how many other documents were
  retrieved in the same batch). **Title retitling and dedup-merging only
  ever mutate a system/agent-derived document** (`source_type` set) --
  a real user-authored page's title or search visibility is never
  silently changed just because it looks generic or happens to share
  content with another page; the review status is still recorded for
  visibility either way.
- **Full prompt/reasoning/token persistence** (task #87, `knowledge_context`,
  adapted from `ai_context`): every real model call -- a chat turn,
  compaction's own summarization call -- persists the *exact* prompt
  actually sent (`system_prompt` + assembled history, verbatim, not
  reconstructed later from `agent_message` rows), the model id, and
  real token counts (`agent_provider_vertex.lua` now parses Vertex's
  own `usageMetadata`; the deterministic test provider returns
  matching estimated counts so the same code path is exercised under
  tests). A reply that leaks visible reasoning (`<think>` tags,
  "Thinking..." prefixes) gets that reasoning split out into its own
  document (`source_type = 'reasoning'`, `reasoning_document_id`)
  rather than a second, parallel log -- reasoning goes through the
  exact same tiering/retrieval/decay pipeline as everything else, and
  is attributed to the real logged-in user, not a synthetic actor (the
  Knowledge Pool folder itself is the only thing authored as
  `"system"`).
- **Chat-reply evaluation + user feedback** (task #87, `knowledge_chat_eval`,
  adapted from `ai_chat_eval`): every chat reply is classified
  (`final` / `reasoning-visible` / `error` / `empty`), and the chat
  widget has a thumbs up/down on each assistant reply
  (`/api/chat-widget-feedback`, ownership-checked the same way every
  other chat-widget route already is -- a user can only give feedback
  on their own conversation's replies).
- **No more materialization step** -- `knowledge.materialize_note` and
  its destructive `AGENT_TOOLS.knowledge.materialize` entry were removed
  under task #106: every pool document already is a real page from the
  moment it exists, so there's no separate "promote a hidden tracking
  record into a real page" step left to gate. The old agent-driven
  review pass (`agent.run_knowledge_review`, `platform knowledge
  review`) was removed for the same reason -- its one job was deciding
  what to materialize.
- **Real agent-driven distillation, on demand** (task #107,
  `knowledge.distill`): a destructive `AGENT_TOOLS` entry that writes a
  genuinely new, concise, single-idea document extracted from a source
  the agent has actually read (via `entity.get`), not a raw mirror of
  it -- the real replacement for the old materialize/review pass, doing
  what that pass never actually could (it only ever promoted a tier
  number). Always starts at tier 0 like any new pool document, filed
  under the Knowledge Pool folder with `source_type = 'distilled'`
  pointing back at its source. `knowledge.list`'s tool output includes
  each document's `atomicity_status` (`ok`/`thin`/`needs-split`) so the
  model can tell what's actually worth distilling from. Triggered
  explicitly (`platform knowledge distill`, dispatched from `main.lua`
  directly rather than `knowledge.do_knowledge` itself, for the same
  knowledge/agent circular-require reason `review` used to be) -- a
  genuine write, so it pauses for human approval exactly like
  `document.create`/`entity.create`.
- **Reactive distillation, tied to real usage** (task #108,
  `knowledge.maybe_distill`): explicit user direction against a
  periodic/cron-style scan of the whole pool ("it should be just part
  of the general usage processing... pages that are frequently
  retrieved and audited might generate new atomic documents"). Instead,
  `knowledge.review_retrieval` calls `knowledge.maybe_distill` inline,
  in the same request, the moment a document's `target_tier` reaches 2
  ("Curated Draft" -- the same promotion bar `document.
  promotion_target_tier` already applies) *and* it has no distilled
  derivative yet (`knowledge.already_distilled_from`) *and* its
  atomicity isn't already `ok`/`thin`. That guard makes this a rare,
  at-most-once-per-source-document cost, not a per-search tax. Unlike
  `knowledge.distill`, this is a single direct `agent_provider.generate`
  call (not a full tool-calling agent session) and always auto-executes
  -- no pending-action approval -- since it's a rule-triggered side
  effect of review, not a model choosing to act, and it's additive-only
  (never edits/deletes an existing document). Attributed to the real
  user whose retrieval triggered it (`author`, threaded through
  `knowledge.search_and_log` -> `review_retrieval` -> `maybe_distill`),
  not a synthetic actor.
- **Whole chat sessions are themselves documents** (task #108 follow-up,
  explicit user direction: "every conversation with the agent is itself
  saved as a document"). `agent.run_turn` calls `sync_session_document`
  at the end of every real turn (every terminal status except a hard
  provider error), which builds a human-readable transcript
  (`build_session_transcript`, reusing `agent.all_messages`' own
  display-cleanup) and finds-or-creates/updates one document per session
  via `knowledge.sync_session_document` (`source_type = 'chat_session'`,
  `source_ref` = the session's own id -- not `source_id`, since
  `agent_session` ids are opaque hex text, not the integer `source_id`
  column). `agent_session`/`agent_message` stay the authoritative,
  append-only event log (never folded into `document` the way
  `knowledge_note` was -- that would lose per-message ids, compaction,
  and the FK `knowledge_context`/`knowledge_chat_eval` key off); the
  synced document is a derived, searchable *projection* of that log, the
  same relationship a rendered page has to its raw Markdown. Because
  it's a real document, a heavily-revisited conversation participates in
  the exact same tier/heat/distillation pipeline as anything else --
  "combine what a conversation touched into something durable" falls
  out of the existing mechanism with no separate code path needed.
  Real, known tradeoffs accepted as-is (explicit user decision, not
  overlooked): (1) every real turn now ledgers a write against the
  *global*, cross-entity-type id sequence (`ledger.append_create`'s own
  `entity_event` autoincrement) -- so ids for unrelated entity types
  created in the same session are no longer small/predictable, which is
  fine for real usage but means tests must look rows up by a stable key
  (title, `source_ref`) rather than assume a specific id; (2) a
  transcript that happens to contain a user's own search terms (it
  usually will -- it recorded their query) can itself show up in a
  later search for those same terms, which is a real, accepted echo
  effect, not a bug.
- **Hand-rolled tables, not `schema.register()` entities** --
  `knowledge_retrieval`/`knowledge_retrieval_document`/
  `knowledge_review`/`knowledge_context`/`knowledge_chat_eval` are
  system/derived event logs (own `CREATE TABLE` + `init_schema`), the
  same treatment as `document_link`/`document_embedding`/
  `agent_session`, not user-authored data with its own field-level
  audit needs -- these are about retrieval/review *events*, not pool
  content itself, so they reference `document.id` directly rather than
  living on `document`.
- **Surfaced two ways**: `platform knowledge <stats|list|show|promote|
  distill>` (CLI, mirrors `document.do_document`'s dispatch shape), and
  a `/knowledge` page linked from System (gated identically -- Setup or
  Admin capability) with stat tiles, the tier breakdown, and a
  recent-retrievals list. Deliberately not its own sidebar icon -- chat
  session browsing (`/chat`) is one link away from here instead of a
  dedicated nav-rail entry.
- **Spreading activation** (task #106 follow-up, explicit user
  direction to fold the existing link graph into retrieval/context
  scoring): a retrieved document's linked neighbors
  (`document.linked_neighbors`, both directions over `document_link`)
  get a smaller heat reinforcement too (`knowledge.spread_activation`),
  diluted by fan-out (`document.spreading_delta` -- the ACT-R "fan
  effect": a heavily-linked hub document gives each neighbor a
  proportionally smaller nudge). Only `heat`/`last_retrieved_at` move
  for a spread neighbor, never `retrieval_count` -- that column
  specifically measures direct retrieval hits (`promotion_target_tier`
  reads it that way); a neighbor's tier can still rise from the extra
  heat alone, since `review_retrieval` picks up every document touched
  in the retrieval batch, direct hits and spread neighbors alike.
- **Deferred, not built**: a `knowledge-browser` filter page, an
  `ai_note_link`-style co-retrieval graph between documents, and
  agent-assisted linking -- the agent actively proposing/creating new
  `document_link` connections between related documents it notices,
  not just passively scoring the links a user already wrote. That's
  real new write surface (almost certainly a destructive, approval-
  gated `AGENT_TOOLS` entry, same bar as `knowledge.distill`/
  `document.create`), worth scoping properly on its own rather than
  building ad hoc.
