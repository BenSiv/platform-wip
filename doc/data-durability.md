# Data durability & recovery plan

## Current state (updated 2026-07-25 -- production moved off SQLite)

Production now runs on managed Cloud SQL for MySQL, not a single SQLite
file on the boot disk. This doc originally described a SQLite-era plan
(Litestream/backup-cron, still relevant to a from-source/dev SQLite
install); see `doc/mariadb-migration.md` Phase 4 for how and when the
cutover happened, and `doc/architecture.md`'s "Storage" section for the
current dual-backend picture (`src/db.lua` dispatches on
`config.db_backend()`).

For a **from-source or local dev install still running SQLite**
(`.store/store.db`, single file, no network binding), the original
problem statement and Phases 1-3 below still apply as-is. For
**production**, most of what those phases exist to provide is already
covered by Cloud SQL itself:

- **Automated backups + PITR**, configured directly in Terraform
  (`/root/software/infra/gcp/lims/main.tf`,
  `google_sql_database_instance.platform.settings.backup_configuration`):
  daily backups (`enabled = true`, `start_time = "03:00"`),
  `binary_log_enabled = true` (binlogs are what make point-in-time
  recovery possible, not just daily-snapshot granularity), 14 retained
  backups (`retained_backups = 14`, count-based, not day-based).
  This closes the RPO gap Phase 1 below was written to solve --
  Cloud SQL's own binlog-based PITR gives sub-day recovery for free,
  no Litestream/cron needed.
- **Managed failover primitives**: `availability_type = "ZONAL"` today
  (single zone, matching the single-instance `platform` GCE VM it
  serves) -- regional HA is a one-line Terraform change
  (`availability_type = "REGIONAL"`) if that tradeoff is ever revisited,
  not a re-architecture.
- The old SQLite file is kept, untouched, on the instance as a rollback
  artifact only (per mariadb-migration.md Phase 4) -- it is not the
  live source of truth and does not need its own backup plan going
  forward.

**What Cloud SQL's baseline still does NOT give you** (same shape of
gap as the old SQLite plan, just smaller in scope now):

1. **No tested restore runbook** -- nobody has actually run a Cloud SQL
   PITR/backup restore against this instance. A backup no one has
   restored from is still a hypothesis. Phase 2 below (rewritten for
   Cloud SQL) is still open work.
2. **Single instance, single zone actually serving traffic** -- a zone
   outage is still real downtime until `availability_type` is changed
   or a replacement instance is provisioned, same as before.
3. **No verified application-level integrity check on restore** -- a
   restored database being reachable isn't the same as its data being
   correct; nothing here confirms the ledger and its projected tables
   still agree post-restore.

## Recommended plan (phased, cheapest/highest-value first)

### Phase 1 -- SQLite dev/from-source installs only (Cloud SQL already covers prod)

If running from source against SQLite (no `PLATFORM_DB_BACKEND=mariadb`
set), the original plan still applies: switch to WAL mode
(`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;`) and either run
[Litestream](https://litestream.io/) or a systemd timer doing
`sqlite3 store.db ".backup /tmp/backup.db"` + upload on an interval.
Not relevant to production anymore -- skip straight to Phase 2 there.

### Phase 2 -- Documented, tested restore runbook (still open)

For production (Cloud SQL): pick a throwaway/staging Cloud SQL instance,
actually run a PITR restore (`gcloud sql backups restore` or a
clone-to-point-in-time) against it, point a `platform` container at the
restored instance's connection name, and confirm:

1. The app starts and login works.
2. A spot-check of known records/ledger entries survived intact.
3. `platform ledger verify`-style integrity check (if one doesn't exist
   yet, a small CLI addition) walks the ledger and confirms every
   projected table still matches its log -- so a restored backup's
   integrity is machine-checked, not just "app started successfully."
4. Time the whole thing -- that duration is the real RTO, not a guess.

Write the actual steps taken down in this section once run for real.

### Not recommended (for now)

- **Multi-zone hot standby / automatic failover** -- meaningful added
  complexity (replication lag, split-brain handling) that a single-
  company internal LIMS tool likely doesn't need; `availability_type =
  REGIONAL` (a much smaller step, see above) plus a drilled restore
  runbook (Phase 2) is probably the right tradeoff point unless an
  explicit uptime SLA says otherwise. Revisit if that changes.

## Critical files
- `/root/software/infra/gcp/lims/main.tf` -- `google_sql_database_instance.platform`, its `backup_configuration` block, instance tier/zone
- `/root/software/infra/gcp/lims/module/platform_compute/templates/startup-platform.sh.tpl` -- where the app's DB connection is configured (`PLATFORM_DB_BACKEND`, Cloud SQL Auth Proxy sidecar)
- `/root/projects/platform-wip/src/db.lua` -- backend dispatch (`is_mariadb()`); where a `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` call would be added for the SQLite dev path
- `/root/projects/platform-wip/doc/mariadb-migration.md` -- the full cutover history/rationale
- `/root/projects/platform-wip/doc/architecture.md` -- "Storage" section, current dual-backend picture
