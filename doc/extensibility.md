# Extensibility

The extension system exists so that behavior specific to one
deployment's own needs -- a validation rule, a reaction to a record
being created or changed -- never has to be written into the platform
itself. An extension is a small script, version-controlled the same
way a record type definition is, that declares up front what it needs
and gets exactly that and nothing more.

## Extension layout

```
extensions/<name>/
  manifest.lua
  main.lua
```

A manifest is a small declarative file, loaded the same sandboxed way
a record type definition is (see `schema.md` and `architecture.md`) --
one language for everything a definition or extension author writes,
no separate config format:

```lua
-- extensions/unique-lot-number/manifest.lua
return {
  name = "unique-lot-number",
  events = {"entity.before_create", "entity.before_update"},
  entity_types = {"reagent"},
  capabilities = {
    read = {"entity"},
    write = {},
    net = "none",
  },
}
```

```lua
-- extensions/unique-lot-number/main.lua
-- Bare assignment scopes to its enclosing block (not the whole chunk,
-- as stock Lua's globals would be) -- there is no `local` keyword.
function on_before(new, old, ctx)
  issues = {}
  if old == nil or new.lot_number != old.lot_number then
    dup = ctx.query("reagent", {lot_number = new.lot_number})
    if #dup > 0 then
      table.insert(issues, {field = "lot_number", severity = "error",
        message = "Lot number already registered"})
    end
  end
  return issues
end
```

## Event model

| Hook | Timing | Can it block? | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `entity.before_create` / `entity.before_update` | Synchronous, as part of saving the change | Yes -- returned issues can block the save | Validation rules |
| `entity.after_create` / `entity.after_update` / `entity.after_archive` | Queued when the change is saved, executed later | No | Notifications, derived-record computation, external sync |

Before-hooks and after-hooks are deliberately different code paths, not
a timing flag on the same one: a slow or broken after-hook must never
be able to hang or corrupt someone's data entry, so it doesn't get the
chance to run as part of it at all.

**"Queued," concretely**: an after-hook doesn't run the instant its
event fires. Creating, updating, or archiving a record records a
pending job in the same transaction as the change itself, and that job
only actually executes when something later asks the platform to run
its pending jobs (`entity run-pending`, wired up on whatever schedule a
deployment chooses) -- not as an automatic side effect of the write.
Unarchiving a record does **not** enqueue an after-hook today (only
archiving does) -- not a deliberate design stance, just not wired up
yet.

## Capabilities

A manifest declares what an extension needs; it's granted exactly that
and nothing more when its code actually runs:

- `read: [entity]` -- read-only lookups into current record state via
  `ctx.query(entity_type, filter)`. No raw query language is ever
  exposed.
- `write: [entity]` -- access to create or update records via `ctx`.
  Most extensions (especially validation rules) declare no write
  access at all.
- `net: outbound` -- opts into outbound networking being available to
  the extension. Absent by default; an extension that doesn't declare
  this has no network access, full stop.

An extension needs an explicit approval before any of its hooks run at
all, and the exact capabilities it declared at that moment are what
get recorded as approved. If the manifest's declared capabilities
change afterward, approval is automatically treated as stale until a
human reviews and re-approves it -- an extension can't silently
escalate what it's allowed to touch just by editing its own manifest.

## What extensions cannot do today

- Render their own pages or routes. The event hooks cover the concrete
  cases (integrations, derived-record automation) without this.
- Cross-record-type rules. A rule is scoped to one record type's own
  values, plus read-only lookups into others -- it cannot subscribe to
  every record type at once.
- Anything outside its declared capabilities. There is no "trusted
  mode" escape hatch; if a script needs more, the manifest has to
  declare it and it has to be (re-)approved.
